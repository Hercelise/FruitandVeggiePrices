Fruit and Vegetable Prices Across Years and What They Mean for Consumers and Business Owners
Americans have long struggled with inflation and the overall cost of living.  According to the USDA, or the United States Department of Agriculture, most Americans do not regularly eat enough fruits and vegetables to meet recommended dietary needs (The Cost of Satisfying Fruit and Vegetable Recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines | Economic Research Service, 2016).  Part of the reluctance to buy fruits and vegetables is cost.  However, some healthy eating is available at a relatively low cost.

Consumers often see the prices at their local grocery store, and the prices at first glance seem overpriced.  But, incorporating healthy eating habits regularly can cost about the same as filling a basket with processed foods that are fatty, high in sugar, and have high sodium contents (The Cost of Satisfying Fruit and Vegetable Recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines | Economic Research Service, 2016).  However, when budgeting, it can be hard to have an estimate of how much items may cost.  Additionally, fruits and vegetables frequently do not have “deals” to cheapen costs, so purchasing items that are not “2 for $4” can be seen as a deterrent.

Using a database that compiles data from several years for the average costs of fruits and vegetables, along with the various forms in which they can be purchased, such as "fresh," "canned," and "dried," can give consumers an estimate of how much they will likely spend on items.  Businesses can also use this database to determine how much they will spend on items.  This allows them to estimate the prices needed to make a profit.

Consumers who access this database can see both the individual produce options as well as the forms of items sorted by the cheapest as well as most expensive.  They will also be able to see a median price to get an idea of a “middle ground” regarding pricing.  Businesses can also access queries that pertain directly to them.  Some examples of this are displaying the least profitable items and the most profitable items.

The database features two main components that contain the information necessary to compare prices.  Eight different tables provide data on fruits, vegetables, commonly sold form, average retail prices, and the average prices a business pays to receive the produce.  The database covers four different years to analyze, and the data can be sorted and viewed either individually or all together, depending on how the user chooses to run the queries.  The most useful data in each table when looking at finances is the cost of items. The cost figures that can be created allow users to identify the most economical choices over time to predict potential consistencies.  Additionally, tracking cost changes over time can highlight long-term trends to assist with financial planning for businesses and customers.

While there is no true “central” focus in this database, joining tables shows long-term changes in pricing.  Joining tables to see trends is useful when consumers or business owners are interested in predicting possible future prices.  The database follows the assumption that customers and businesses are primarily interested in prices.  This assumption was used since financial concerns regarding buying fresh foods are relevant with inflation trends and wages often not being adjusted to match.  Providing costs also assumes that businesses will price items fairly to sell products while still making a profit.  It is hard to show a diagram due to there being eight independent tables, but they can be linked optionally through “joins.”

The data used for this database was provided by the USDA.  The official USDA website offers data for fruit and vegetable prices from 2013, 2016, 2020, and 2022.  The data, divided into years, is optimal for analysis due to the variety.  Because the data was gathered by a government organization, it is reputable for handling a wide range of data across the United States of America.  The tables contain information for the specific food, the type one can buy said food in, average retail prices per unit prices, standard units which are used automatically to create the average prices, and the average cost of the product a supplier would charge a business.  This last part of the table is what a business would generally expect to pay for the standard serving size that would go on a shelf.
